    <section anchor="Background" title="Background and Motivation">
      <t>The NIST special publication 800-63 defines a linear scale "Level of
      Assurance" measure that combines multiple attributes about an identity
      transaction into a single measure of the level of trust a relying party
      should place on an identity transaction.</t>

      <t>Over the last few years several trust frameworks profiling SP 800-63
      have emerged and as the number of such profiles grow, interoperability
      becomes increasingly problematic. Interoperability between trust
      frameworks is critical in order to support transactions between identity
      providers and relying parties that are part of multiple trust
      frameworks.</t>

      <t>This work seeks to decompose the elements of the measure in a way
      that they can be independently communicated from an Identity Provider to
      a Relying Party, making comparison between trust frameworks easier.</t>

      <section anchor="Model" title="An Identity Model">
        <t>This document assumes the following model for identity. The authors
        acknowledges that this is a partial model and only serves as a point
        of reference for this document.</t>

        <t>The identity subject (aka user) is associated with an identity
        provider which acts as a trusted 3rd party on behalf of the user wrt
        to a relying party by making identity assertions about the user to the
        relying party.</t>

        <t>The real-world person represented by the identity subject is in
        possession of a (cryptographic) primary credential bound to the user
        by (an agent of) identity provider in such a way that the binding
        between the credential and the real-world user is a representation of
        the identity proofing process performed by the (agent of) the identity
        provider to verify the identity of the real-world person.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Architecture" title="Component Architecture">
        <t>The term Vectors of Trust is based on the mathematical construct of
        a Vector, which is defined as an item composed of multiple independent
        scalar values. A vector is a set of coordinates that specifies a point
        in a (multi-dimensional) cartesian coordinate space. The reader is
        encouraged to think of a vector of trust as a point in a coordinate
        system, in the simples form (described below) a 3 dimensional space
        that is intended to be a recognizable, if somewhat elided, model of
        identity subject trust.</t>

        <t>An important goal for this work is to balance the need for
        simplicity (particularly on the part of the relying party) with the
        need for expressiveness. As such, this vector construct is designed to
        be composable and extensible.</t>

        <t>All components of the vector construct must be orthogonal in the
        sense that no aspect of a component overlap an aspect of another
        component.</t>

        <t>The values assigned to each component of a vector is sometimes
        written as an ordinal number (eg an integer) but MUST NOT in general
        be interpreted as having inherent order among other values assigned to
        the same or other components in the vector space. In other words, 1 is
        different from 2, but it is dangerous to assume that 2 is always
        "more" (better) than 1.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Components" title="Core components">
      <t>This specification defines three orthogonal components: identity
      proofing, credential binding, and assertion presentation. These
      dimentions (as described below) are intentionally elided and SHOULD be
      combined with with other information to form trust frameworks can can be
      used as a basis for audits of identity providers and relying
      parties.</t>

      <t>This specification also defines values for each component to be used
      in the absence of a more specific trust framework. It is expected that
      trust frameworks will provide context, semantics, and mapping to legal
      statutes and business rules for each value in each component.
      Consequently, a particular vector value can only be compared with
      vectors defined in the same context. The RP MUST understand and take
      into account the trust framework context in which a vector is being
      expressed in order for it to be processed securely.</t>

      <t>It is anticipated that trust frameworks will also define additional
      components.</t>

      <section anchor="IdentityProofing" title="Identity Proofing">
        <t>The Identity Proofing dimension defines, overall, how strongly the
        set of identity attributes have been verified and vetted, and how
        strongly they are tied to a particular credential set. In other words,
        this dimension describes how likely it is that a given digital
        identity corresponds to a particular (real-world) identity subject.
        Without more specific definition by an associated trust framework</t>

        <t>This dimension shall be represented by the <spanx style="verb">P</spanx>
        demarcator and a level value, such as <spanx style="verb">P1</spanx>,
        <spanx style="verb">P2</spanx>, etc.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="Credential" title="Credential Management">
        <t>Below we use the term "credential" to denote the credential used by
        the identity subject to authenticate to the identity provider.</t>

        <t>The Credential Binding dimension defines how strongly the
        credential can be verified by the IdP and trusted to be presented by
        the party represented by a given credential. In other words, this
        dimension describes how likely it is that the right person is
        presenting the credential to the identity provider, and how easily
        that credential could be spoofed or stolen. This component is intended
        to be a general category</t>

        <t>This dimension shall be represented by the "C" demarcator and a
        level value, such as <spanx style="verb">C1</spanx>, <spanx
        style="verb">C2</spanx>, etc. Note that multiple credential factors
        MAY be communicated simultaneously, such as when Mult-Factor
        Authentication is used. </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="AssertionPresentation" title="Assertion Presentation">
        <t>The Assertion Presentation dimension defines how well the given
        digital identity can be communicated across the network without
        information leaking to unintended parties, and without spoofing. In
        other words, this dimension describes how likely it is that a given
        digital identity asserted was actually asserted by a given identity
        provider for a given transaction.</t>

        <t>This dimension shall be represented by the <spanx style="verb">A</spanx>
        demarcator and a level value, such as <spanx style="verb">A1</spanx>,
        <spanx style="verb">A2</spanx>, etc.</t>

    <section anchor="Combining" title="Communicating Vector Values to RPs">
      <t>All three of these dimensions (and others, as they are defined in
      extension work) MUST be combined into a single vector that can be
      communicated across the wire unbroken.</t>

      <t>All vector components MUST be individually available, MUST NOT be
      "collapsed" into a single value without also presenting the constituent
      dimensions as well.</t>

      <t>When communicating the vectors across the wire, they MUST be
      protected in transit and signed by the asserting authority (such as the
      IdP).</t>

      <section title="On the Wire Representation">
        <t>The vector MUST be represented as a period-separated ('.') list of
        vector components, with no specific order. A vector component type MAY
        occur multiple times within a single vector, separated by periods, in
        which case it is considered an AND of the two values. In order to
        simplify processing by RPs, it is RECOMMENDED that trust framwork
        definitions carefully define component values such that they are
        mutually exclusive or subsumptive in order to avoid this situation
        where possible.</t>

        <t>Vector components MAY be omitted from a vector. If a component is
        omitted, the IdP is making no claim for that category.</t>

        <t>For example, the vector value <spanx style="verb">P1.C3.A2</spanx>
        translates to pseudonymous, proof of shared key, signed back-channel
        verified token in the context of this specification's <xref
        target="default-components">definitions</xref>.</t>

        <t>Vector values MUST be communicated along side of a trustmark
        definition to give the components context.</t>

      <section anchor="OIDC" title="In OpenID Connect">
        <t>The IdP MUST send the vector value as a string with the <spanx
